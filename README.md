# AP-Research-School-Bus-Routing-Problem
This is a research project done on School A, with the goal of reducing school buses' travel times on a school day. Throughout the project, I used real-time
API to collect the travel time data, shown in "Time data". With the time data, I cleaned up the data and imported it into the model, School Bus Routing 
Problem. After which, a route is computed that optimizes travel times of the school buses.
